## 📝 Weekly Reports


### 📖 Week 1 Report

#### 🗓️ Dates: May 12 – May 18

#### ✅ Tasks Completed
- Conducted an in-depth review of the current 3D Human Body activity.
- Identified **missing anatomical assets** (notably internal organs not yet integrated).
- Explored the Z-Anatomy model repository and extracted relevant anatomical assets.
- Began simplification of large FBX models using Blender.
- Increased **spacing between organs** to reduce overlap and improve visibility in the viewer.
- Removed several instances of **duplicate rendering logic** in the current JavaScript implementation and improved function modularity.

### 📖 Week 2 Report

#### 🗓️ Dates: May 19 – May 22
<!--
#### ✅ Tasks Completed
- Successfully **merged the intestine and other models** into manageable and optimized meshs to reduce complexity for children.
- Integrated foundational **3D models for the upcoming Paint Mode activity**, ensuring compatibility with the viewer and interactivity system.
- Refactored major parts of the Human Body activity JavaScript:
  - Split rendering logic into modular helper functions
  - Improved readability and performance
- Imported and **tested the skin model**, adjusted scaling and alignment with internal organs.
- Published **Week 2 blog post** with progress, visuals, and key learnings.

#### 📚 What I Learned
- Techniques for merging and simplifying anatomical meshes using Blender before loading into Three.js.
- Deepened my understanding of Three.js `Scene Graph`, `Object3D` hierarchy, and model transformations.
- Improved ability to maintain clean, modular JavaScript code in a collaborative project.

#### 📋 Plans for Week 3
- Begin developing **Paint Mode** (layer highlighting, group coloring, etc.)
- Add interaction logic for selecting regions/organs.
- Continue UI polishing (tooltips, hover highlights, etc.)
- Prepare models for Doctor Mode integration in Week 4.

#### ⚠️ Challenges
- Some anatomical models (like skin) had **non-uniform scale/orientation**, requiring careful normalization.
- Handling z-fighting (visual overlap) when skin and organs are rendered together.
